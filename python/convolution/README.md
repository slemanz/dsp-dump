## Representing a discrete time signal

Following are the two commonly used methods for representing a
signal.

1. Sequential method.
2. Graphical method.

## Sequential Representation of discrete time signal

Sequential representation of discrete time signal is shown below

$$x(n) = [2,1,-2,-2,3,2,2,-1,1]$$
