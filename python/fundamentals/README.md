# Fundamentals of signal processing

## Signal Processing

Signal processing is the field of science which involves the manipulation of
signal to get the desired shaping, transforming a signal from time domain to
frequency and vice versa, smoothening the signal, separating the noise from
signal i.e filtering, extracting information from the signal.

Signals exist in nature are continuous signal. Continuous-time (or analog)
signals exist for the continuous interval (t1,t2). This interval (t1,t2) can
range from -inf to inf.

## Basics of signal processing system

Since computer needs digital signals for processing, therefore, in order to use
an analog signal on a computer it must be digitized with an analog-to-digital
converter.Thus, there is a need for an interface between the analog signal and
the digital signal processor.
