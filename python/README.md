## Signal Processing

Signal processing is the field of science which involves the manipulation of
signal to get the desired shaping, transforming a signal from time domain to
frequency and vice versa, smoothening the signal, separating the noise from
signal i.e filtering, extracting information from the signal.

## Why Signal Processing?

Since the availability of digital computers in the 1970s, digital signal
processing has found its way in all sections of engineering and sciences.
Following areas of sciences and engineering are specially benefitted by rapid
growth and advancement in signal processing techniques.
