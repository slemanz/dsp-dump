# Linear Systems and Superposition

## Linear Systems

### What is a System?

A process that produces an output signal in response to an input signal.

### What is a Signal?

A signal describes how one parameter relates to another.

### Signal Naming Notation

- Continuous signal use <u>parentheses</u>: x(t), y(t)
- Discrete signal use <u>brackets</u>: x[t], y[t]

### Information Encoding in Analog Waveform

- **Time domain enconding:** informtation is encoded in the sine waves of the
signal.
- **Frequency domain encoding:** information is encoded in the shape of the waveform.

### Properties of Linear System

- Homogeneity
- Additivity
- Shift Invarience

**The Homogeneity Property:**

- A change in the amplitude of the input signal results in a corresponding
change in the amplitude of the output signal.

**The Additivity Property:**

- A system is said to be additive if added signals pass through it without
interacting.

**The Shift Invariance Property:**

- A shift in the input signal causes an identical shift in the output signal.
