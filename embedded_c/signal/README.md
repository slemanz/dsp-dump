# Signal Statistics and Noise

## Introduction to Signals

What is a signal?

- A signal describes how one parameter relates to another.

Continuous vs Discrete Signal

- Signal in the real-world are continuous by nature
- Passing a continous signal through an analog-to-digial converter converts it
to a digitized or discrete signal.

Independent vs Dependent Variables

- A signal is made up of two parameters, the independent variable and the
dependent variable.
- The vertical axis represents the dependent variable while the horizontal axis
represents hte independent variable.
- The dependent variable (y-axis) is a function of the independent variable
(x-axis)
- The independent variable describes how and when a sample is taken, the
dependent variable is actual measurement.

Signal Samples

- Each digitized signal point is known as a sample.
- The total number of sample is denoted by **N**
